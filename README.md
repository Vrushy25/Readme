Objective:
Design a database structure for your system, ensuring it is normalized, efficient, and scalable.
Instructions:
1.	Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
Step 1: Identify Entities and Their Attributes
To design an efficient database, we must first identify the key entities (tables) that represent different components of the system. Let's assume we are designing a Skill-Bridge platform, which connects professionals with companies for short-term projects, internships, or mentorship programs.
Entities and Their Attributes
1.	Users (stores information about users, including professionals and recruiters)
o	user_id (PK, Unique ID for each user)
o	first_name
o	last_name
o	email (Unique)
o	password
o	user_type (ENUM: ‚ÄòProfessional‚Äô, ‚ÄòRecruiter‚Äô)
o	created_at (Timestamp)
2.	Profiles (stores additional details about professionals)
o	profile_id (PK)
o	user_id (FK)
o	bio
o	skills (Text format, comma-separated or JSON)
o	experience_level (ENUM: ‚ÄòBeginner‚Äô, ‚ÄòIntermediate‚Äô, ‚ÄòExpert‚Äô)
o	linkedin_url
3.	Companies (stores information about recruiters' companies)
o	company_id (PK)
o	company_name
o	industry
o	location
o	website
4.	Projects (short-term skill-based tasks posted by recruiters)
o	project_id (PK)
o	company_id (FK)
o	title
o	description
o	required_skills (Text format, JSON)
o	budget
o	status (ENUM: ‚ÄòOpen‚Äô, ‚ÄòClosed‚Äô, ‚ÄòIn Progress‚Äô)
o	created_at (Timestamp)
5.	Applications (tracks applications submitted by professionals)
o	application_id (PK)
o	project_id (FK)
o	user_id (FK)
o	cover_letter
o	status (ENUM: ‚ÄòPending‚Äô, ‚ÄòAccepted‚Äô, ‚ÄòRejected‚Äô)
o	applied_at (Timestamp)
6.	Reviews (stores feedback and ratings for professionals)
o	review_id (PK)
o	reviewer_id (FK, refers to user_id of recruiter)
o	professional_id (FK, refers to user_id of professional)
o	rating (1-5 scale)
o	comments
o	reviewed_at (Timestamp)

Step 2: Establish Relationships Between Entities
Now, let's define the relationships between these entities:
‚Ä¢	Users and Profiles ‚Üí One-to-One (One user has one profile)
‚Ä¢	Users and Companies ‚Üí One-to-Many (A recruiter can belong to one company, but a company can have many recruiters)
‚Ä¢	Companies and Projects ‚Üí One-to-Many (A company can post multiple projects)
‚Ä¢	Users and Projects (via Applications) ‚Üí Many-to-Many (Professionals apply to multiple projects, and a project receives multiple applications)
‚Ä¢	Users and Reviews ‚Üí One-to-Many (A professional can receive multiple reviews from different recruiters)

Step 3: Create the ER Diagram
 










2.	Define Database Tables:

Below are the SQL table definitions for each entity in the Skill-Bridge system. The database design follows normalization principles, including 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

1. Users Table
Stores information about users (both professionals and recruiters).

CREATE DATABASE SkillBridge;

USE SkillBridge; 

-- Create the Users table
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Unique ID for each user (Primary Key)
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,         -- First Name (not null constraint)
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,          -- Last Name (not null constraint)
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,      -- Email (unique and not null)
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,          -- Password (store hashed values)
    user_type ENUM('Professional', 'Recruiter') NOT NULL,  -- User type (Enum with two options)
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  -- Timestamp when the user is created
);
SCREENSHOT OF TABLES AND OUTPUT:
 

CREATE TABLE Profiles (
    profile_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Unique profile ID
    user_id INT,                                -- Foreign Key to Users table
    bio TEXT,
    skills TEXT,                                -- Skills in JSON format or comma-separated
    experience_level ENUM('Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Expert') NOT NULL,
    linkedin_url VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

 

CREATE TABLE Companies (
    company_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Unique company ID
    company_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    industry VARCHAR(50),
    location VARCHAR(100),
    website VARCHAR(255)
);

 

CREATE TABLE Projects (
    project_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Unique project ID
    company_id INT,                             -- Foreign Key to Companies table
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    required_skills TEXT,                      -- Skills required in JSON format or comma-separated
    budget DECIMAL(10, 2),
    status ENUM('Open', 'Closed', 'In Progress') NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES Companies(company_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

 



CREATE TABLE Applications (
    application_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Unique application ID
    project_id INT,                                -- Foreign Key to Projects table
    user_id INT,                                   -- Foreign Key to Users table
    cover_letter TEXT,
    status ENUM('Pending', 'Accepted', 'Rejected') NOT NULL,
    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES Projects(project_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

 

CREATE TABLE Reviews (
    review_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Unique review ID
    reviewer_id INT,                           -- Foreign Key to Users table (Recruiter)
    professional_id INT,                       -- Foreign Key to Users table (Professional)
    rating INT CHECK(rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),   -- Rating between 1 and 5
    comments TEXT,
    reviewed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (reviewer_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (professional_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

 

3.	Provide Sample Queries:

Here are 7 sample SQL queries that demonstrate key functionalities of the SkillBridge system, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

1. SELECT Query - Retrieve all users and their profiles
This query retrieves information about all users along with their associated profile details.
. SELECT Query - Retrieve all users and their profiles
This query retrieves information about all users along with their associated profile details.
SELECT u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email, p.bio, p.skills, p.experience_level, p.linkedin_url
FROM Users u
JOIN Profiles p ON u.user_id = p.user_id;

SCREENSHOT AND OUTPUT:
 


2. INSERT Query - Add a new user and profile
This query inserts a new user and their associated profile into the Users and Profiles tables.
-- Insert a new user
INSERT INTO Users (first_name, last_name, email, password, user_type)
VALUES ('Alice', 'Smith', 'alice.smith@example.com', 'hashed_password', 'Professional');

-- Insert a new profile for the user
INSERT INTO Profiles (user_id, bio, skills, experience_level, linkedin_url)
VALUES (LAST_INSERT_ID(), 'Senior Web Developer', 'HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React', 'Expert', 'https://linkedin.com/in/alicesmith');

 

 

3. UPDATE Query - Update a user's profile information
This query updates the skills and experience_level for a user with a specific user_id.
UPDATE Profiles
SET skills = 'HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js', experience_level = 'Expert'
WHERE user_id = 1;

 

4. DELETE Query - Delete a user and their associated profile
This query deletes a user and their associated profile from the system.
-- Delete the profile associated with the user
DELETE FROM Profiles WHERE user_id = 2;

-- Delete the user from the Users table
DELETE FROM Users WHERE user_id = 2;

 

5. SELECT Query - Get all projects for a specific company
This query retrieves all projects for a specific company identified by company_id.

SELECT p.project_id, p.title, p.description, p.status, p.created_at
FROM Projects p
JOIN Companies c ON p.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE c.company_id = 1;

 

6. SELECT Query - Get reviews given by a specific recruiter
This query retrieves all reviews given by a specific recruiter to the professionals they reviewed.
SELECT r.review_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, r.rating, r.comments, r.reviewed_at
FROM Reviews r
JOIN Users u ON r.professional_id = u.user_id
WHERE r.reviewer_id = 1;
